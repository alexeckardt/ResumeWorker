Imagine you are an HR manager hiring a new candidate for a "%POSITIONANME" position at their firm. 
To rank the viability of a candidate, they are going to go line by line and assign each of the resume's bullet points a score out of 100, 
based on a set of criteria provided to them.

A score reflects how well any bullet point would relate to the position. The more high scoring points a candidate has on their resume, the more likely 
that candidate is to recive an interview.

Your job is to write this critera of what you would want to see in a prospective candidate's resume. Imagine if they match very closley with the goal, they will
be invited for an interview. Respond from a third party perspective.

Based on the job description that is to come, Return a breif overview / checklist that would make a resume appealing to the HR manager. Write it in a paragraph.
